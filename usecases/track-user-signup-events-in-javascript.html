post transactions bypass normal payment checks, and what it means for you.&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;force-post-the-payment-hack-that-lets-merchants-charge-you-without-approval&quot;],&quot;content_markdown&quot;:[0,&quot;Back in 2022, I was on holiday in Auckland for a friend’s wedding when I noticed something alarming: \\$6,000 had been debited from my account.\n\nThe transaction was made through Amazon, and I initially suspected my card had been compromised. Oddly, there was no notification from my bank or Amazon.\n\nI contacted my bank, and after some internal processes on their end, they managed to recover my funds — but only after four to five days.\n\nWhat I experienced was a classic example of a force post transaction.\n\n## What is a Force Post Transaction?\n\nNormally, when you make a payment to a merchant, the transaction must pass through multiple layers of checks before it can be authorized. These checks typically include:\n\n* Is the merchant blocked?\n* Does the account have sufficient funds?\n* Is the card’s CVV correct?\n* Has the card been reported stolen?\n* Is the IP address associated with fraud?\n\nAnd so on.\n\nHowever, an old mechanism exists where a merchant can bypass these safeguards. This is known as a force post transaction.\n\nHistorically, this was associated with physical retail POS (point of sale) systems. If their internet connection went down, the system would still allow them to process a transaction offline. Once connectivity was restored, the transaction would be finalized.\n\n## Which Merchants Allow Force Post?\n\nToday, force posting is virtually unsupported by online payment processors. Platforms like Stripe, PayPal, and Adyen do not allow it.\n\nThat said, large platforms like Amazon, Steam, and others have built their own billing infrastructure over time (fun fact: even Stripe doesn’t use its own platform for internal billing).\n\nThese companies often work with multiple merchant banks, some of which may still support force posting under certain conditions.\n\n## What Does Force Post Mean for Merchants?\n\nLet’s be clear: force post transactions are a **chargeback minefield**.\n\nIf a customer disputes the charge, merchants typically have **no defense**. They also bear the full liability if the card turns out to be fraudulent, if the transaction details are invalid, or if other authorization errors occur.\n\nIn short, there’s very little advantage for merchants to use force posting today. It’s useful only in rare, edge-case scenarios:\n\n* A service business where a client refuses to pay the remaining balance.\n* A milkshake stand where the internet connection fails, but the transaction needs to be completed.\n\n## How to Protect Yourself From Force Post Transactions\n\nMaintaining proper account hygiene goes a long way in protecting your funds. Here’s what I personally do to minimize risk:\n\n* Maintain a current (primary) account with only minimal funds, used for daily and online transactions.\n* Keep a secondary bank account where the majority of your money is stored.\n\n* Do not link a debit or credit card to the secondary account.\n* Do not use the secondary account for any online purchases.\n\nIf you want to go one step further, keep the secondary account at an entirely different bank for additional protection.\n\n---\n\nForce post transactions are a relic of an older payment era, but they still carry real risks today. \n\nUnderstanding how they work and how to protect yourself can save you from unexpected losses and unnecessary headaches.&quot;],&quot;banner_og&quot;:[0,null],&quot;category&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,2],&quot;status&quot;:[0,&quot;published&quot;],&quot;sort&quot;:[0,1],&quot;date_created&quot;:[0,&quot;2023-10-07T08:24:39.000Z&quot;],&quot;date_updated&quot;:[0,&quot;2025-02-05T00:57:04.000Z&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;6 Best practices for early stage B2B SaaS customer support&quot;],&quot;banner&quot;:[0,&quot;204bf6f4-442f-4c73-ac2b-a048c9cb7f6f&quot;],&quot;subtitle&quot;:[0,&quot;A list of 6 helpful tips on delivering the best customer support for your users.\n\nAimed at founders who are running early stage B2B SaaS businesses and want to provide the best customer support with the least headaches.&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;b2b-saas-customer-support-best-practices&quot;],&quot;content_markdown&quot;:[0,&quot;When I first started Swipekit, I always wanted to provide excellent customer support.\n\nAnd why not? I mean everyone in the tech space would emphasis quality customer support as a gamechanger.\n\nA year later and these are some best practices I&#39;ve learnt from providing customer support.\n\n## Add a live Chat Software\n\nEarly on, I installed Crisp.chat as my live chat system. This came with a widget that I could embed on my webapp and I can reply to my customers either from their webapp or from the Crisp app.\n\nThis was a gamechanger. Instead of waiting for them to send me an email, they can simply click on the widget and send me a message.\n\nRight after installing Crisp, I installed their app. Now I could reply to my users from anywhere.\n\n![](https://writings.operational.co/assets/e4761fd2-6eb3-4f17-8e6d-b7c5b0f07ad7?format=webp&amp;quality=80)\n\nPS, not shilling for Crisp but they are the best choice for early stage businesses. Intercom is too expensive and tawk.to has a really hideous design.\n\nThere are other solid options too if you want to explore.\n\n## Try to reply as quickly as possible\n\nAfter adding the live chat software, I would talk to as many users as possible.\n\nOver time, one thing became apparent. 90% of my replies won&#39;t get any responses back. But the 10% that did? They always were the ones where I replies ASAP to their query.\n\nKnowing this was a gamechanger.\n\nWhy is this so important? When you start openly talking to your users, you get to know how they found you, how do they find your app, etc. Being able to talk to them in an open manner will open up lots of exciting possibilities.\n\n![This guy became a paying user over a year later](https://writings.operational.co/assets/9bd53cbf-e7d0-4f02-ba39-34360c4b3860?format=webp&amp;quality=80)\n\nThis guy became a paying user over a year later\n\nFor Swipekit, I got referrals, testimonials, hard-to-find bugfixes, and much more from these long chats.\n\n&gt; Since I&#39;m based in AEST timezone and all my customers are on the other side of the world, I would sleep with my laptop, quite literally.\n&gt; \n&gt; \\- Shash from Swipekit\n\nSo I highly recommend to start talking to your customers quickly - event if it means sleeping with your laptop :P\n\n## Label your webapp with the right terminology\n\nOften times, there are clashes with how your users interpret your webapp. They may say library, but they mean webapp. You may think webapp but they think dashboard.\n\nThese are silly issues that can come out of language barriers, differences in technical prowness, etc.\n\nOne way to resolve this is to internally refer to specific parts of your app with a specific terminology.\n\nFor instance, when I rebranded my own SaaS, I made sure everything had a specific name.\n\nThis was also reflected in my marketing copy, support docs, etc\n\n## Communicate in a specific tone\n\nThe tone you use when messaging your customers will set the stage for the entire conversation.\n\nIn my experience, interactions with other SaaS business owners over support chat have generally been pleasant. However, there are ways to further improve these interactions:\n\n*   Be brief but polite. Customers need quick help, not lengthy discussions about the local weather.\n    \n*   Acknowledge their query immediately but provide a detailed answer later.\n    \n*   Read their query at least twice. Important details can often be missed in a single reading, and you don&#39;t want to misunderstand their issue.\n    \n*   If you can&#39;t help them, be honest about it. A straightforward answer can quickly turn a frustrated user into a loyal fan.\n    \n\nExamples:\n\n*   Instead of \&quot;Hey, what&#39;s wrong?\&quot; use \&quot;How can I help you?\&quot;\n    \n*   Instead of \&quot;Your trial is over, you need to pay for X product,\&quot; use \&quot;Your trial has expired. You can continue using X product by paying at xyz.com/billing.\&quot;\n    \n\nFundamentally, maintaining a consistent tone is crucial. When things go sideways, keeping your tone steady rather than changing it based on the situation will help maintain a professional interaction.\n\n## Create a documentation page\n\nOnce you start chatting with customers, you&#39;ll soon realise that their problems are already solved from prior customer chats.\n\nAt this stage, you need to start working on a documentation page. This can be a simple page or you can use something like a knowledgebase SaaS for this. Crisp has something like this anyways.\n\nFor Swipekit, I opted to write my content in my headless cms. This ensured that I can display my docs right inside my webapp as well as in the marketing pages - so they get indexed.\n\nAfter doing so, I added a small automation to Crisp that would tell users to refer to the docs before trying live chat.\n\n## Remove your live Chat software\n\nEventually as you grow bigger, you&#39;ll want a more structured support system around. Live chat only works until it doesn&#39;t.\n\nFor instance, I would also get really annoying chat requests.\n\nMike from Senja also noted how they were getting crappy requests. So they turned their live chat off - and surprisingly their operations were much smoother.\n\nIf you absolutely must - keep live chat in, but only for specific scenarios.\n\nFor instance, we at Swipekit don&#39;t show out live chat until the user turns into a paying customer. This massively reduced inane queries.\n\n### Other tips and tricks\n\nHere are some more tips that may or may not be applicable to your business\n\n**Resolve customer support queries like a pyramid**\n\nStart with the easiest possible solution, and explore more complex solutions afterwards. This is how I do it for my own SaaS.\n\n![Start with basic queries, then make your way to the top](https://writings.operational.co/assets/8366af93-fa50-4a77-a25c-a7a899bf7238?format=webp&amp;quality=80)\n\nStart with basic queries, then make your way to the top\n\n1\\. When someone has a query, I first direct them to my docs. This is done semi automatically by referencing the docs page as my first chat inside Crisp.\n\n2\\. If that doesn&#39;t work, then I ask them to try common workarounds(eg, have your tried restarting your device?)\n\n3\\. If that doesn&#39;t work, I ask them their setup, so I can possibly replicate it. For instance, do they have other extensions installed, are they using a vpn, etc.\n\n4\\. If nothing works, I ask them to get on a quick video chat. Video chat with screensharing pretty much fixes the problem.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nI hope these best practices were helpful for your SaaS biz.

Show me the email of the person who signed up.\n    \n*   Show me when a user&#39;s trial ended.\n    \n*   Show me if a particular feature worked as intended.\n    \n\netcetc.\n\nInitially, I had nothing to view this data on. I knew I had to setup something because early on, tracking and fixing bugs ASAP was a big priority.\n\nAfter setting up event tracking, I immediately got visibility over the most important actions taking place in my SaaS.\n\nHere&#39;s how my Telegram looks like after setting up event notifications.\n\n![](https://writings.operational.co/assets/a54a6d0e-b142-4cda-984a-842be159a408?format=webp&amp;quality=80)\n\nI&#39;m going to show you how to setup event tracking for your SaaS, for free.\n\n## Setting up tracking via Telegram to track events\n\nMost SaaS builders on twitter were already using Slack or Discord to track various events.\n\nI opted for Telegram. Here&#39;s why.\n\nFirstly, I didn&#39;t use Stack for my work. I did use something similar called Pumble but that was exclusively for liaising with freelacers and contracts. And I certainly didn&#39;t want to setup Slack just for notifications.\n\nSecondly, I&#39;m not a big fan of Discord. I&#39;m part of 10+ discords and opening up Discord is like opening up a zoo. Every few seconds, a random ping would go off and I had no idea where it came from.\n\nThis left me with Telegram. I had used Telegram before and I really liked it UI. Plus they had easy to use docs(not that Slack, Discord, etc were bad).\n\nThe only issue with Telegram is their search function, which doesn&#39;t work most of the time.\n\nAnyways, here&#39;s how I did it.\n\nI created a simple function on my nodejs server that interfaces the the telegram API.\n\n```\nconst TelegramBot = require(&#39;node-telegram-bot-api&#39;);\n\nconst bot = new TelegramBot(process.env.TELEGRAM_TOKEN, {});\n\nasync function sendMessage(msg) {\n  bot.sendMessage(this.chatId, message).catch((err) =&gt; {\n\t\tconsole.log(err);\n\t});\n}\n\nexports = module.exports = sendMessage;\n```\n\nThat&#39;s it. Now I&#39;d call this function whenever I wanted to track something.\n\nHere&#39;s one where I&#39;m tracking a background job:\n\n![Tracking background jobs](https://writings.operational.co/assets/dc988f81-b353-4dd8-9443-24af3f04dfd4?format=webp&amp;quality=80)\n\nTracking background jobs\n\n## Going further\n\nThis solution helps me figure out issues, but it has some issues.\n\nHere&#39;s what I want:\n\n*   More context inside a notification. For instance, If a user&#39;s trial expired, how much activity did they do?\n    \n*   Ability to send commands back to my server. For instance, if a user&#39;s trial has expired but they have performed enough activity and have signed up via a company email, send them a trial extension offer.\n    \n\nRight now, I&#39;m trialing a way to send commands back to the telegram bot so it can fire webhooks to my server. But this is still quite far away.\n\nI hope this simple guide helps you setup event tracking for your SaaS. Event notifications can help you figure out what your users are up to, and you can proactively help them figure out their issues.\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to holla at me on twitter/X at @shash122tfu&quot;],&quot;banner_og&quot;:[0,&quot;21807df5-2fad-436f-a7ac-45ba3bf12645&quot;],&quot;category&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,11],&quot;status&quot;:[0,&quot;published&quot;],&quot;sort&quot;:[0,3],&quot;date_created&quot;:[0,&quot;2023-11-18T11:44:20.000Z&quot;],&quot;date_updated&quot;:[0,&quot;2025-02-05T00:56:16.000Z&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;How to get high quality users for your B2B SaaS business?&quot;],&quot;banner&quot;:[0,&quot;a7d9c02c-85eb-4c78-b722-cb58439b8af5&quot;],&quot;subtitle&quot;:[0,&quot;A list of business rules I have setup in place for getting high quality customers.&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;how-to-get-high-quality-users-for-your-b2b-saas&quot;],&quot;content_markdown&quot;:[0,&quot;When I started Swipekit, I had a wide open signup setup. Meaning that everyone could sign up for my SaaS without any hurdles.\n\nThis doesn&#39;t seem bad since most folks in the startup world recommend removing any blockers to signups.\n\nTurns out, for a B2B business, you need to have your signup workflow relatively restrictive.\n\nWhy you shouldn&#39;t allow anyone to signup for your B2B SaaS?\n\n*   I saw a lot of users signing up, using the product, then after their trial would expire, they would signup with another email address.\n    \n*   Users were very hesitant to ask for feature requests, report bugs, and just generally, open a dialogue with me.\n    \n*   Because of these users, we weren&#39;t getting better quality metrics(We certainly don&#39;t want to analyze behaviours of users who don&#39;t intent to pay for the product)\n    \n*   The support messages we got were horrible from these users. Bad product requests, dumb responses, and more.\n    \n*   And lastly, our conversion ratios were bad.\n    \n\nAll these issues would lead to more operational problems for my SaaS.\n\nIt became very clear that I had to put mechanisms in place to get more high quality users for my self-serve SaaS.\n\n## How to actually get high quality users?\n\nIn my 1 year of running Swipekit, I gradually started implementing rules in place to get quality users.\n\nHere&#39;s what I implemented:\n\n### Set a email verification system\n\nThis is the most basic thing you can do to verify that john@acme.com is the real owner of that email.\n\nInitially, Swipekit allowed users to signup, but they won&#39;t be able to save more than 3 Ads unless they clicked the verification link inside their emai.\n\nThis was a bad decision as folks would signup and then download 3 ads and then move along.\n\nSo I made my onboarding in such a way that after the initial signup process, they need to verify their email.\n\nPhew this blocked a ton of crappy signups.\n\n### Don&#39;t allow throwaway emails\n\nSome users would:\n\n*   Signup via a throwaway email\n    \n*   After their trial is over, signup with another throwaway email\n    \n\nThis was a clear indicator that this user won&#39;t pay for the product.\n\nThe solution was simple - get a list of [throwaway email providers](https://github.com/disposable/disposable-email-domains) and block signups from them.\n\n### Don&#39;t allow 10 minute emails\n\nThis is the spiritual successor of throwaway emails. These services buy 20-30 domains, then allow people to create fake email accounts for 10 minutes. Problem is - unlike throwaway emails, they actual do work.\n\nThe best way to ban them is to figure out their dns&#39;s ip address - and ban that ip. But that&#39;s a bit more involved process(I might write another article about it in the future)\n\n### Proactively ban users\n\nSometimes, you just need to ban users manually.\n\nWe do this during a couple of scenarios:\n\n*   When they issue a chargeback\n    \n*   When their email bounces. We can see this from our transactional email provider. This basically means that they are using a sort of a throwaway email service.\n    \n*   When they are being abusive in the support chat. Happened only once though.\n    \n\nTo setup a ban system, I made a simple table called banlist. This table has these columns:\n\n*   text - the string to check against\n    \n*   type - email or domain enum. If email is selected, don&#39;t allow signups if the entire email matches text column. If domain is selected, don&#39;t allow signup if the domain part of the email matches the text column.\n    \n*   createdAt - just cause\n    \n*   banTill - In case I need to add a temporary ban. Not used at the moment.\n\n### Don&#39;t allow gmail&#39;s +1 trick\n\nGmail allows users to have multiple email address, on a single email address.\n\nEssentially, a single gmail email address can be used as multiple emails as long as there&#39;s a + character in the email.\n\nFor instance, if you&#39;re gmail is john@gmail.com\n\nYou can signup as john+1@gmail.com , john+abc@gmail.com ,etc. Here&#39;s a [detailed explaination](https://medium.com/verses-education/an-easy-gmail-hack-for-signing-up-multiple-user-accounts-that-require-an-email-address-4aba56e29248).\n\n**What&#39;s the fix?**\n\nIt&#39;s very simple. During signup, just check if the email provider is gmail and there&#39;s a + character inside the email. If yes, don&#39;t allow signup.\n\n## Taking this further\n\nSo far, these rules have drastically improved the quality of users. Still, there&#39;s one thing that will totally eliminate all unwanted users.\n\n**Ask for their card details during signup.**\n\nDoing this will pretty much overnight cut down low quality signups. As much as I&#39;d love to set this up, unfortunately we are a long way from implementing this.\n\n## Notes\n\n*   I wish I had implemented this rules from day one. This would&#39;ve cut down crappy signups and alleviated a whole lot of operational headaches.\n    \n*   Asking for a credit card during signup will drastically cut down signups. I need to improve my onboarding, docs, etc before I can safely implement this.\n    \n*   I can also ask for company email signups only. I don&#39;t do this simply because we have heaps of valid paying users who signed up via gmail, yahoo or other providers.&quot;],&quot;banner_og&quot;:[0,&quot;f8786473-bc87-45f3-aef8-dd1d020191a1&quot;],&quot;category&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,12],&quot;status&quot;:[0,&quot;published&quot;],&quot;sort&quot;:[0,4],&quot;date_created&quot;:[0,&quot;2023-11-26T01:43:09.000Z&quot;],&quot;date_updated&quot;:[0,&quot;2025-02-05T00:54:51.000Z&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;A complete guide on chargebacks for SaaS businesses&quot;],&quot;banner&quot;:[0,&quot;3d093402-c996-4b51-8ca1-3d64048163c2&quot;],&quot;subtitle&quot;:[0,&quot;This is massive guide on understanding chargebacks, avoiding getting hit by one, and contesting one. All tailored for early stage SaaS businesses.&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;complete-guide-on-chargebacks-for-saas-businesses&quot;],&quot;content_markdown&quot;:[0,&quot;Back when I started my SaaS, there was no decent information on chargebacks. Especially in the context of SaaS businesses.\n\nOver a year of running Swipekit, and having eaten a couple of chargebacks, here&#39;s all my knowledge on this topic - so you don&#39;t have the same mistakes I made.\n\nBrace yourself, this is a 2000+ word behemoth.\n\n## What is a chargeback?\n\nWhen a customer starts paying for your SaaS, they are getting into a business relationship. When they believe that your have wrongfully charged that under these two circumstances, they may issue a chargeback:\n\n*   **Charge error** - When a customer believes your services haven&#39;t been provided. Eg, product not working.\n    \n*   **Fraud charge** - When a customer&#39;s card was stolen and someone else use their card without their authorization to pay for your product.\n\nThese are the two main reasons. There are other sub-reasons too.\n\n[Chase bank explains this](https://www.chase.com/personal/credit-cards/dispute) pretty well. Just scroll down to the second section.\n\nBeing issued a chargeback means the business relationship has ended. This is when you need to immediately stop service to the customer.\n\nAbout fraudulent chargebacks - some users will signup willingly to your service, then after some time, declare their transactions as fraudulent, eg they didn&#39;t sign up/pay themselves. Then they will chargeback.\n\nThis type of chargeback is categorized as a fraudulent chargeback, but it is commonly known as friendly fraud.\n\n### Why friendly fraud?\n\nFriendly fraud can happen when a user goes through their transactions, see a transaction that they may not recognize, and then subsequently do a chargeback.\n\nOr they may be aware that a charge is valid and still do a chargeback.\n\nYes this is very much possible.\n\nThis happens a lot in ecommerce, where a person buys a product, receives it, and THEN does a chargeback for product not received or stolen credit card.\n\nThis type of chargeback is called friendly fraud, and it is unfortunately the most common type of chargeback and also the hardest to contest.\n\nFor the rest of this guide, we&#39;ll be talking in the context of fraudulent chargebacks.\n\n## Why are chargebacks bad for your business?\n\nUnlike any other variable in your business, a high amount of chargebacks will certainly destroy your business. Think of it as the proverbial meteorite that destroyed the dinosaurs(aka your business).\n\nHere&#39;s how it works:\n\nWhen you get a chargeback, Stripe(or any other payment provider) will increase your dispute activity. This can be viewed in your Stripe dashboard.\n\nWhen this dispute activity reaches a certain threshold over a certain number of months(eg, 0.75%+ over 3 months), Stripe may start withholding your money over a longer period of time, or even shut down your account permanently.\n\n![If this gets to 0.75% for over 3 months, we&#39;re toast](https://writings.operational.co/assets/8a13a4d4-e62a-4e26-8cfd-8a73431738a7?format=webp&amp;quality=80)\n\nIf this gets to 0.75% for over 3 months, we&#39;re toast\n\nBeyond this, you also need to pay a small fee to Stripe per dispute(~$15USD)\n\nAnd to make matters worse, scummy customers can dispute charges more than 1 month. So if they have been paying for 4 months, and they chargeback you for those 4 months, you will have 4 different chargebacks issued against you, not just one.\n\nAnd yes, you need to pay chargeback fee for all 4 months.\n\nAnd it gets better - even if you win a dispute, your dispute activity still remains high, and you need to pay the fee.\n\nThis is why chargebacks are no joke, and you need to take steps to bulletproof your business against chargebacks as early as possible.\n\n## How to reduce chargebacks\n\nThere isn&#39;t one solution, but rather a whole heap of actionable solutions you can take to strengthen your business against chargebacks.\n\nBut first, know your obligations.\n\nAs a business owner, you need to make sure you have covered your bases. You can&#39;t leave your business processes up to ambiguity.\n\nAsk yourself these questions:\n\n*   Can my users easily cancel their subscription?\n    \n*   When they sign up, do they agree with my terms?\n    \n*   Is there a refund process? How does it work?\n    \n*   Do they get a notification whenever my business charges them on a recurring basis?\n    \n\nIf you can honestly answer these questions, move on to the next section.\n\nOtherwise, here&#39;s what you need to do to fulfill these questions.\n\n### Can my customers easily cancel their subscription?\n\nYour customers should clearly know how to cancel subscriptions. At Swipekit, when someone starts their subscription we send them an email where we transparently tell them they can cancel their subscription from this link. We&#39;ve also put these instructions in our documentation section.\n\n[Here&#39;s the docs for Swipekit](https://swipekit.app/help#how-do-i-cancel-my-paid-subscription-account) explaining users how can they cancel their subscription.\n\nIf you&#39;re using Stripe portal, know that most customers still find it hard to cancel their subscription from there(from my experience). What they want is explicit terminology around their subscription cancellation. \n\n![Note the text at the bottom of the form](https://writings.operational.co/assets/2c0f71d2-682b-4810-a405-22d4d53aa8b2?format=webp&amp;quality=80)\n\nNote the text at the bottom of the form\n\nFor my own business, I disabled cancellations through portal and implemented my own cancellation form. This helps customers cancel from my app itself, and as a bonus I can collect better insights on why someone cancelled.\n\n### When they sign up, do they agree with my terms?\n\nAs part of the signup process, they need to agree to your terms and conditions. You can do this by making them tick a checkbox which tells them they agree to your terms. Obviously if they haven&#39;t ticked this checkout, don&#39;t allow them to signup.\n\n![You basically need this tickbox to mitigate a whole host of chargebacks](https://writings.operational.co/assets/7ea20956-7632-489d-a000-bee4bffb4ac4?format=webp&amp;quality=80)\n\nYou basically need this tickbox to mitigate a whole host of chargebacks\n\nThe whole point of getting them to explicitely agree them to your terms is so that when they chargeback you, you can show this process to the bank and tell them the customer agreed to the terms before signing up.\n\nFurthermore you also need to add your refund policies, chargeback policies, etc clearly in your terms.\n\n### Is there a refund process? How does it work?\n\nHaving a transparent refund process will alleviate chargeback pain. In most countries, you need to have a 30 day refund process - so I highly recommended making that a standard.\n\nNow, if someone wants a refund, you need to have a clear process. Even if you don&#39;t issue refunds for whatever reason, as long as this is made clear to your users, you&#39;ll be fine.\n\nWhatever your refund policy is - you need to make sure it is clearly outlined in your terms-of-service page. Here&#39;s [Harvest&#39;s terms](https://www.getharvest.com/terms-of-service) as an example. Note how clear they are about their refund policy(no refunds)\n\n### Do they get a email when they are charged on a recurring basis?\n\nYour customers need to get an email, sms or something where they are reminded that they will be charged for your product&#39;s next month subscription.\n\nIf you don&#39;t notify them, it will be much harder contesting a chargeback. This is also great because in the case of a chargeback, your emails to the customer will stand up as proof during the dispute process.\n\nIf you can answer confidently on ALL the above points, you are protected from most chargeback attempts.\n\nHowever you can do much more to avoid chargebacks.\n\n### Use Stripe Radar\n\nChances are, you&#39;re using Stripe. And Stripe has a product called Radar. This product is a value add on top of all transactions. Radar essentially allows you to block fraudulent transactions.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nFirstly, Radar isn&#39;t a drop-in toggle-on-and-say-goodbye-to-chargeback solution. You&#39;ll need to configure it. Radar is essentially a bunch of toggles, sliders and rules you configure to allow who gets to pay for your product.\n\nThese are the options Radar give you to migitate fraud:\n\n*   Block cards if they are throwaways(like gift cards)\n    \n*   Block cards by ip, country, etc\n    \n*   Block cards by Stripe&#39;s internal risk score\n    \n*   Explicitely ask for 3d secure, if available\\*\\*\n    \n\nSurprisingly, there&#39;s very little discourse online on setting up Radar properly.\n\nMy $2 cents is to block high risk transactions(&gt;60 score), block where anonymous\\_ip was used, and block if CVC verification fails.\n\nBeyond this, Radar rules vary greatly between business to business. What one set of rules are applicable to a business, might not work at all for another set of business. You need to figure this out based on your business.\n\nHere&#39;s an [article](https://www.chargebackstop.com/) that gives a good general purpose Radar rules, but you&#39;ll still need to implement your own specific rules.\n\nLastly, Radar&#39;s risk level score is infamously known to be dodgy. Once your business starts growing, look into using other factors to determine fraudulent users, not just the risk level.\n\n### Disallow low quality customers from signing up\n\nIf you&#39;re running a B2B business, you actually want to restrict your signup process to allow only vetted users.\n\nThis is easier said than done. Apart from asking for a credit card upfront, there are a lot of different verification techniques you can use to get high quality users. [I&#39;ve made a whole guide on this topic.](https://operational.co/articles/how-to-get-high-quality-users-for-your-b2b-saas)\n\nNot allowing bad customers is the best approach to avoiding chargebacks. Plus you&#39;re also sure the high quality users who do sign up will have a greater chance of being paying customers.\n\n### Use the 3rd party products to detect friendly fraud\n\nThere are a few products out there which can detect if a card is more likely to chargeback.\n\nThis is beyond the scope of this topic but you can look into chargebacks911, chargeblast, etc.\n\nHow do these products work? Once you signup and get onboarded, they will &#39;listen&#39; to chargebacks made on your transactions.\n\nOnce a chargeback is made by a customer, it usually take a few hours - to days to actually file the chargeback. During this time you will be notified of the chargeback and you can refund the transaction and take necessary steps against the user.\n\nWe have gone through the most common techniques, but at the end of the day, users are gonna chargeback. There&#39;s no escaping that.\n\n## When should you contest chargebacks?\n\nMost people in the early stage SaaS category would tell you to eat the cost and move on. This is horrible advice - at least early on.\n\nIf anything, you want to fight chargebacks. This will make your review your processes and help you understand what went wrong and how can you prevent something from happening again.\n\nAnyways, here&#39;s how it works:\n\nWhen you get a chargeback, Stripe(or your payment provider) will give you 14 - 30 days to dispute a chargeback. If you don&#39;t do anything, the customer wins the dispute automatically.\n\nDuring these timeframe, you need to gather evidence to tell them that:\n\n*   Hey, this customer signed up on xyz date, logged in on abc date, paid for the product on jkl date. You need to show emails and relevant logs, if any.\n    \n*   You need to craft a letter that makes it very very obvious that the customer is in-fact, the one who paid for the product.\n    \n*   Lastly, don&#39;t appeal to emotion, appeal to logic. The guy reviewing your dispute probably has 5 minutes max on your case.\n    \n\nThis will usually result in 3-4 documents. One will be the letter to Stripe documenting the timeline, one will be relevant logs(including ip addresses), another will be customer communications(emails and support logs), etc.\n\nAlso, get the reason code for said chargeback. Every bank has a different set of rules for dealing with chargeback disputes and reason codes outline those rules. Look up the reason code for your chargeback and prepare your documents accordingly. Here&#39;s [one](https://www.americanexpress.com/content/dam/amex/au/en/merchant/static/chargebackcodeguide.pdf) for amex.\n\nNow send these documents through Stripe and wait for the outcome. Resolution typically takes months so don&#39;t hold your breath though.\n\nFor gathering evidence, you need to go to your transactional email provider and gather logs. I use Resend which makes this stupidly simple. For chat logs, I simply screenshot chats from Crisp.chat(the chat widget I&#39;m using). I also send a simple about-the-business.pdf which explains at a high level what my business does and why this chargeback was in error.\n\n## Notes\n\nAs much as I make chargebacks sound scary, they are relatively rare. They are also more of a concern for younger businesses. More established businesses can easily eat a couple of chargebacks every month without any issues.\n\nPS - if you absolutely loathe the idea of contesting chargebacks, use a merchant-of-records, like Lemon Squeezy, Paddle, etc.\n\nWhat&#39;s a merchant-of-record(MoR)? They essentially charge the customer on your behalf, and then transfer the money to you. Think of them as a middleman. And because of this arrangement, they eat the chargebacks.\n\n### Glossary of important terms\n\n*   B2B - Business-to-Business\n    \n*   Payment processor - Bank or 3rd party service which processes payment on your behalf. Charges have your business name on them.\n    \n*   MoR - Merchant of Record. Charges(Statement descriptors) have their name on them.\n    \n*   Dispute rate - This is the metrics provided by Stripe.\n    \n*   Dispute activity - This metrics is used by VISA and Mastercard to determine if you&#39;re having an above average dispute rate.\n    \n*   3D Secure - This is when the card holder&#39;s bank will issue a OTP to the user to authorize a payment. Doing so shifts the liability to the user&#39;s bank, and is usually a good defense against fraudulent chargebacks. Note that Stripe charges you a small amount per 3D Secure attempt.&quot;],&quot;banner_og&quot;:[0,&quot;63169f3b-6e26-4549-9e4a-4d104cd03c26&quot;],&quot;category&quot;:[0,&quot;star&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,13],&quot;status&quot;:[0,&quot;published&quot;],&quot;sort&quot;:[0,5],&quot;date_created&quot;:[0,&quot;2024-06-10T03:56:19.000Z&quot;],&quot;date_updated&quot;:[0,&quot;2025-02-05T00:57:20.000Z&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;How we won a chargeback against Amex (and you can win one too!)&quot;],&quot;banner&quot;:[0,&quot;b63f7188-559d-4530-a2f7-d289d170c225&quot;],&quot;subtitle&quot;:[0,&quot;Our epic saga on how we won two disputes against us by AMEX bank.&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;how-we-won-chargeback-against-amex-how-you-can-win-chargeback&quot;],&quot;content_markdown&quot;:[0,&quot;Here&#39;s a tale for the grandkids. My business got 2 chargebacks and we.. won?\n\nWhat makes it even more interesting is that the chargebacks were filed through Amex. For those not in the known, Amex loves chargebacks. They are infamously known for always siding with the customer.\n\nIf you don&#39;t know much about chargebacks and would like to know more, here&#39;s an [in-depth article](https://operational.co/articles/complete-guide-on-chargebacks-for-saas-businesses) I wrote sometime ago.\n\n## How it all started+\n\nThis customer, we&#39;ll call them C, signed up sometime in January. Their trial ended and they promptly signed up for our paid subscription.\n\nAfter about 2 months of usage, their card payment failed so we deactivated their account(our business rule) and sent them an email letting them know about it.\n\nA few weeks after this, they filed a chargeback for their last payment.\n\nHere&#39;s where things turned spicy. A day after they filed a chargeback, we sent them an email stating that we intend to dispute the chargeback unless they revert the chargeback. If they do revert, we promise to refund them their amount.\n\n![The damage has been done. I might as well collect my pound of flesh.](https://writings.operational.co/assets/ac48d6b9-9d25-493b-837b-d1d18c11c962?format=webp&amp;quality=80)\n\nThe damage has been done. I might as well collect my pound of flesh.\n\nNext thing you know, C filed another chargeback for their first transaction a day after this email was sent. Whether this was done in vendetta or there was a time lag, we don&#39;t know.\n\nObviously we banned C but the damage was done. I had to dispute the chargebacks now.\n\n## Disputing the chargebacks\n\nAmex gave us 14 days to dispute the chargeback. Since we have a short timeframe to gather dispute evidence, we immediately went to work.\n\nFirst, we did some research into this specific chargeback type. We were hit with a \&quot;subscription cancelled\&quot; chargeback. Contesting this means understanding what this means.\n\nAside from the chargeback type, Stripe also gives a specific chargeback code. This chargeback code maps to the bank/card&#39;s internal dispute code system, and is more relevant to the chargeback.\n\nIn our case, it was code 4544. \n\nSo we looked up Amex&#39;s definition of chargeback code 4544. Here&#39;s a handy [list of all chargeback codes](https://www.americanexpress.com/content/dam/amex/au/en/merchant/static/chargebackcodeguide.pdf) for Amex.\n\nAccording to Amex&#39;s docs, in order to challenge and win this chargeback, I&#39;ll need to prove this:  \n\n*   Proof that a correcting Transaction, which directly offsets the disputed Transaction, has already been processed.\n    \n*   Evidence that this Chargeback was raised in error and the disputed Transaction does not qualify under this Chargeback reason.\n    \n\nQuite frankly, this sounded vague. I pondered over this for some time and came with this conclusion - The first line meant that I had already processed a refund, which is not true, so I&#39;ll ignore that. The second line means that the chargeback was in error. Now to prove this I need to show that:\n\n*   The customer never cancelled their subscription.\n    \n*   The customer willingly signed up to our service and read our Terms, which state that they have 30 days to get a refund AND they can cancel their subscription anytime from within the app.\n    \n*   We also need to give the banks other documents with kyc data.\n\nAlright, let&#39;s get to work.\n\nFirst, we prepared a pdf doc with these bits:\n\n*   A basic description of our business\n    \n*   Timeline of the events\n    \n*   Proof that this chargeback was in error\n    \n*   Proof that the customer agreed to the terms of Sale\n    \n*   Activity logs\n    \n*   Refund policy\n    \n\nWe created a single pdf with all the information needed to dispute. Stripe also wants documents with various details, so we also created 4 other documents:\n\n*   refund and cancellation policy doc\n    \n*   Invoice of the transaction(from Stripe)\n    \n*   Terms of sale\n    \n*   A basic pdf describing our business\n    \n\n![Phew, this took a lot of time](https://writings.operational.co/assets/00b376ba-bffa-4344-9d73-87a5ec068ddd?format=webp&amp;quality=80)\n\nPhew, this took a lot of time\n\nSince both chargebacks were similar in nature, we sent the same documents in the other dispute(but modified the main customer communications pdf)\n\nIn case you&#39;re wondering what I wrote down, here&#39;s a combination of all these [files in a single document](https://writings.operational.co/assets/16875bc2-cf22-45de-876b-cb29a57594ad). All customer emails are replaced with \\[redacted\\].\n\nI used the information I gathered about the Amex code and gave an angle to the document. This was in the section  \&quot;Proof the chargeback was in error\&quot;. I also tried using the same language these banks used in their codes pdf.\n\nWe also sent a activity log seperately. This was a csv with the ip addresses of all logins of C.\n\nHere&#39;s how it looked like:\n\n![First 3 columns are ids. One of them is the userId. Fourth column is IP address. Fifth column is datetime field](https://writings.operational.co/assets/de4d11d4-c8a7-4462-b862-469996418c9e?format=webp&amp;quality=80)\n\nFirst 3 columns are ids. One of them is the userId. Fourth column is IP address. Fifth column is datetime field\n\nI collect this information and store it in my database. It was trivial exporting this as a csv using Sequel Ace.\n\n## Submitting dispute evidence\n\nSubmitting these documents through Stripe is relatively straightforward. Try to submit as many documents as you can, even if it feels like overkill. I believe we gave Stripe 4-5 documents.\n\nDuring this process, Stripe will guide you through the documentation process.\n\n![I left the access activity log blank but uploaded a csv with the login data](https://writings.operational.co/assets/6c14cb7e-2766-4038-ae7e-94d15c85a688?format=webp&amp;quality=80)\n\nI left the access activity log blank but uploaded a csv with the login data\n\nFor the Refund and cancellation section. I took a screenshot of the signup page and uploaded it as part of the document. And I clicked on &#39;Yes&#39;(the screenshot is incorrect here)\n\n![Finally done, now sit back and wait.. for 3 months!](https://writings.operational.co/assets/f485bab1-569b-4dd2-b160-ecfa6a46cadc?format=webp&amp;quality=80)\n\nFinally done, now sit back and wait.. for 3 months!\n\nThe entire submission process was quite smooth. Note that once you submit, you cannot amend your application.\n\nOnce you&#39;re done with the application, don&#39;t expect a quick reply. Banks usually take 2-3 months to decide. In our case it took just a bit less than 3 months.\n\n## Pyrrhic victory\n\nThinking nothing of it, I continued on as usual with Swipekit. Come May 30th, we got notifications from Stripe that we won! We got the original amount back. Yaaa!\n\nTo be clear, this chargeback was filed under &#39;subscription\\_cancelled&#39;. I&#39;ve been told it&#39;s nearly impossible winning &#39;fraudulent&#39; chargebacks.\n\nHowever, if I were to count the hours I spent gathering the evidence and managing the whole situation, it felt like a slap on the face. Plus my dispute activity was still the same as before(not that it mattered too much - we already have low dispute activity)\n\nAll in all, it definitely felt like a pyrrhic victory. The only satisfaction was the delight from knowing C had to eat $60.\n\n## Learnings\n\nSince writing this article, we haven&#39;t got a single chargeback. After this incident I spent a lot of time honing our processes to ensure this never happens again. And even if it happens we&#39;re prepared.\n\nHere&#39;s my learnings from dealing with chargebacks:\n\n*   Make sure you control the signup flow. Don&#39;t allow [bad actors to signup](https://operational.co/articles/how-to-get-high-quality-users-for-your-b2b-saas) at all.\n    \n*   Banks weirdly need to know the customer&#39;s login activity for contesting disputes. Store login details like the ip address and the userId of all customers in a database table.\n    \n*   Make sure your (Stripe)Radar rules are solid. I&#39;ll write a seperate article on this topic.\n    \n*   Make sure you have a solid Terms and Conditions page. People do read this.\n    \n*   Make sure your cancellation flow is simple and easy to process. The default cancellation flow that Stripe checkout comes with, is not good enough.\n    \n\nFunnily, a few months ago I got notified about this customer trying to login back in -  unsuccessfully of course.&quot;],&quot;banner_og&quot;:[0,&quot;72bfdcf7-c795-489f-940e-a9903c589cab&quot;],&quot;category&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,15],&quot;status&quot;:[0,&quot;published&quot;],&quot;sort&quot;:[0,6],&quot;date_created&quot;:[0,&quot;2024-06-10T11:06:03.000Z&quot;],&quot;date_updated&quot;:[0,&quot;2025-02-05T00:57:46.000Z&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;How to write a terms &amp; condition page for your tech business&quot;],&quot;banner&quot;:[0,&quot;81237c80-8112-4de8-8ca9-63886f866212&quot;],&quot;subtitle&quot;:[0,&quot;A Basic Guide on Writing a Terms &amp; Conditions Page for Your SaaS.&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;write-saas-terms-of-service-page&quot;],&quot;content_markdown&quot;:[0,&quot;Writing a terms and conditions page can feel overwhelming, but it doesn’t have to be.\n\nA well-crafted terms page isn’t just legal boilerplate—it protects your business, reduces chargebacks, and builds trust with users.\n\nThis guide breaks down what you need to include and why it matters.\n\n## Why a Good Terms Page Matters\n\nA well written terms page offers tangible benefits:\n- Fewer refunds and chargebacks\n- Higher chances of the banks siding with you for chargeback cases.\n- Lower risk of lawsuits from disgruntled users\n\nContrary to popular belief, your terms page doesn’t need to be full of legal jargon. The best ones are easy to read and clearly outline expectations.\n\n## Who Reads Your Terms?\nYour terms page will be reviewed by three main groups, in order of importance:\n\n1. Your users – Some users will read the terms before signing up, especially those hesitant to commit.\n2. Banks – If a user files a chargeback, banks will check your terms for a refund policy.\n3. Lawyers – If someone wants to file a legal claim, they’ll look at your terms to assess their options.\n\n## Writing Terms for Your SaaS Business\nStart by writing your terms for your users. Include key sections like refunds, acceptable usage, and cancellations. Then, add sections for legal protection, like liability clauses and AI-generated content disclaimers if applicable.\n\n### Sections to Include in Your Terms\nThere is no strict rule about what sections you need to include. Here&#39;s a list of the most common sections found in terms pages. Feel free to add your own.\n\n#### Definitions\nClarify important terms used throughout the document. This can go at the beginning or end.\n\n#### About Your Business\nNot required, but helpful. A short description of your business makes it easier for third parties to understand what you do.\n\n#### General Rules\nLay out basic guidelines for users, such as:\n- Signing up with a valid email\n- Providing accurate personal information\n- Prohibiting impersonation or abuse\n- Banning illegal content like child pornography\n\n#### Refund Policy\nThis is one of the most-read sections. Place it near the top for easy access.\n\nExplain if you offer refunds and under what conditions. Contrary to popular belief, you are not legally required to offer refunds, but you must clearly state your policy upfront.\n\n#### Cancellation Policy\nSpecify what happens when:\n- A user deletes their account\n- An account is terminated for violating your rules\n\nClarify how long user data will be retained after cancellation.\n\n#### Liability Clause\nThis is for legal protection. If a user loses money or business due to your SaaS, can they sue you? If not, this section should explicitly state that your business is not liable for damages.\n\n#### AI-Generated Content (Optional)\nIf your SaaS uses AI, include a disclaimer that AI-generated content may be unpredictable and that you are not liable for its outputs.\n\n#### Affiliate Terms (Optional)\nIf you run an affiliate program, consider having a separate terms page for affiliates. If you include it in your main terms, clarify:\n- Cookie duration\n- Payment timeline\n- Minimum payout threshold\n- Prohibited promotional tactics, like bidding on your brand’s search terms\n\n## Examples of Well-Written Terms Pages\nYou don’t need heavy legal language to have an effective terms page. The best ones are clear and readable.\n\nOne of my favorite examples is Harvest’s Terms &amp; Privacy Policy:\n\n![](https://writings.operational.co/assets/595b4916-0ec5-409f-bae4-9e567ab44ddb)\n\nSwipekit also has a well-structured terms page worth checking out.\n\n## Closing Thoughts\nUse this guide as a baseline, but consult a lawyer if needed. A good terms page can protect your business and make expectations clear for users, banks, and legal entities.\n\nTaking the time to write clear, readable terms can save you a lot of trouble in the long run.\n\n&quot;],&quot;banner_og&quot;:[0,&quot;b0718827-7875-49e1-be32-4fe1b8375623&quot;],&quot;category&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,18],&quot;status&quot;:[0,&quot;published&quot;],&quot;sort&quot;:[0,11],&quot;date_created&quot;:[0,&quot;2024-06-12T09:36:06.000Z&quot;],&quot;date_updated&quot;:[0,&quot;2025-02-05T00:58:05.000Z&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Top 4 cataclysmic problems for your SaaS&quot;],&quot;banner&quot;:[0,&quot;a44e5193-9697-4eb4-af3b-3d43e1990a98&quot;],&quot;subtitle&quot;:[0,&quot;A list of problems that can wipe out your SaaS business overnight.&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;top-4-devastating-events-for-your-business&quot;],&quot;content_markdown&quot;:[0,&quot;Running a SaaS business comes with inherent risks, but some problems can be outright catastrophic.\n\nThese aren&#39;t just minor setbacks, they can completely wipe out your business overnight. From payment disputes and market shifts to third-party dependencies and lawsuits, understanding these risks is crucial for your business&#39;s long-term survival.\n\nThis article breaks down the four most dangerous threats to your SaaS and how to mitigate them.\n\n## 1. Dispute Activity Above 1%\nIf your chargeback rate exceeds 1% of your transactions for more than three months, your Stripe account could be deactivated or you may face higher fees. While chargebacks are typically an issue for early-stage businesses, they can become a major risk if not handled properly.\n\n![](https://writings.operational.co/assets/8a13a4d4-e62a-4e26-8cfd-8a73431738a7)\nIf this goes above 1% for 3 months, its gg.\n\nHowever, your biggest risk with chargebanks is with credit-card testing. This is where fraudsters will semi-automatically make payments through your service with stolen cards. They can test upwards of 100s of cards on a hourly basis.\n\nThis might increase your revenue for a bit, but when the legal owners of these cards see the transactions, they will initiate chargebacks. A big number of chargebacks overnight can get Stripe to ban your account.\n\nThe best solution is to block [fraudulent users from signing up](https://operational.co/articles/how-to-get-high-quality-users-for-your-b2b-saas). If your signup process is rock solid, they cannot automate their card testing service and leave you alone.\n\n## 2. Target Market Crashing Overnight\nSometimes, the entire market your SaaS depends on collapses due to **regulatory changes, economic downturns, or sudden shifts in consumer behavior**. When this happens, your business may gradually decline until it’s no longer viable.\n\nSome possible causes:\n- A new law makes your service illegal or heavily restricted.\n- A competitor launches with a 10x better offering and completely dominates your space.\n- Customers no longer need your service due to technological advancements or industry shifts.\n\nThere are no possible solutions, only mitigations. For instance, if you develop a paid plugin for a tool, know that the tool owners can replicate your functionality for free.\n\nIf you&#39;re plugin gets popular enough, you want either expand to other marketplaces or offer a standalone version - or sell it off. [Fomo&#39;s original plan](https://fomo.com) came from this risk mitigation strategy.\n\n## 3. Third-Party API Dependency Failing\nIf your SaaS relies on a third-party API, you’re at risk of losing your business overnight. Imagine building a service around **Google Drive**, only for Google to suddenly **discontinue their API**. Without warning, your product stops working.\n\nThis is especially dangerous for businesses that depend on:\n- **App Store policies** (Apple/Google may change their terms, cutting off revenue streams).\n- **Cloud services** (AWS, Google Cloud, or other platforms can increase pricing or change limits).\n- **Data scraping** (If a website changes its UI or blocks bots, your SaaS might become unusable).\n\nAs with the previous risk, there are only mitigations available. For instance, if you have an App store app, you want to expand by offering an Android version and a web version.\n\nWith Api services, you want to choose providers that are not VC backed, or have multiple competitors, and/or have a open source version.\n\nDon&#39;t get rugpulled!\n&lt;blockquote class=\&quot;twitter-tweet\&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=\&quot;en\&quot; dir=\&quot;ltr\&quot;&gt;The lesson we have to re-learn every 5 yrs &lt;a href=\&quot;https://t.co/9rHqrDhLbs\&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/9rHqrDhLbs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Jason Bosco (@jasonbosco) &lt;a href=\&quot;https://twitter.com/jasonbosco/status/1850344412716372143?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\&quot;&gt;October 27, 2024&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=\&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\&quot; charset=\&quot;utf-8\&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n## 4. Lawsuits\nLegal trouble can **cripple your business financially** and even shut it down completely. Getting sued by a much larger company can drain your funds, regardless of whether you win or lose.\n\n### Notable Examples:\n- **CalmFund vs. SureSwift Capital** – Horrible lawsuit that drained CalmFund&#39;s resources. CalmFund no longer exists☠️.\n- **CoffeeZilla vs. Jake Paul** – A media lawsuit that drained significant resoures of the plaintiff. Still ongoing.\n- **Cloudflare vs. Patent Trolls** – Cloudflare survived due to its financial strength, but smaller businesses wouldn’t.\n\n### Possible solutions\n- Make sure you&#39;re doing business under a legal entity as opposed to solo ownership\n- Make sure your terms &amp; conditions page is rock solid. Consider getting it vetted by a lawyer experienced in tech matters.\n- Once your SaaS gets large enough, it is worthwhile looking into business insurance.\n- Keep some money aside for legal expenses. A simple legal letter can cost ~1000 usd so save appropriately.\n- Make friends with lawyers. No I&#39;m not kidding. If something happens and legal intervention is needed, they can help you find referrals.\n\n## Closing Thoughts\nWhile these risks are rare, mitigating them early on can increase your SaaS business’s longevity. Diversifying revenue streams, managing risk factors, and ensuring legal protection are crucial to survival.\n\nStay prepared, and your SaaS will have a much better chance of thriving.\n\n&quot;],&quot;banner_og&quot;:[0,&quot;5a53f32b-235c-4c6f-bc7d-39747826fa4e&quot;],&quot;category&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,19],&quot;status&quot;:[0,&quot;published&quot;],&quot;sort&quot;:[0,12],&quot;date_created&quot;:[0,&quot;2024-06-19T01:59:49.000Z&quot;],&quot;date_updated&quot;:[0,&quot;2025-02-05T00:58:31.000Z&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Basic Guide to Setting Up Your New SaaS business&#39;s Operations&quot;],&quot;banner&quot;:[0,&quot;d25cafc3-eae2-40b9-957d-9a7baa48a458&quot;],&quot;subtitle&quot;:[0,&quot;A practical guide to setting up operational foundations for your new SaaS business. Covering domain management, email setup, transactional &amp; marketing emails.&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;guide-to-new-saas-business-operations&quot;],&quot;content_markdown&quot;:[0,&quot;Starting a SaaS biz requires more than just writing code. Before diving deep into coding, here&#39;s a list of operations you can setup to avoid confusion and unnecessary bikeshedding later on.\n\nThis guide covers key areas like domain setup, email management, transactional and marketing emails, and proper documentation. By handling these early, you’ll save time, avoid confusion, and make your business more manageable.\n\n## Domain Setup\nChoosing the right domain is crucial for branding and credibility. A strong domain makes your business look professional and helps users trust your brand. I recommend using [Domainr](https://domainr.com) to find a good domain name. Once you&#39;ve chosen one, register it with a service like Cloudflare.\n\nI recommend favouring support and developer experience over price. Saving a few bucks for a yearly domain won&#39;t help you much. Unfortunately most domain providers don&#39;t provide good support. You&#39;re better off picking stability over price.\n\nTo manage your domain, use [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) for DNS resolution. Alternatives like AWS Route 53 and BunnyCDN are also solid choices.\n\nYour domain should be structured as `xyz.com` for your landing page and `app.xyz.com` for your web app. Always enable SSL for security and keep URLs clean by avoiding `www` in your domain. Feel free to break these rules but this has become a standard of sorts for new businesses and it is in your best interest to stick to this convention.\n\n## Email Setup\nSetting up a email ensures your business appears legitimate and helps with deliverability. [Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com) is a solid choice because emails sent from it are widely accepted, and it has higher cold email limits(than standard gmail). If you need alternatives, consider Zoho Mail, Fastmail, or ProtonMail if you value privacy.\n\n## Transactional Emails\nYour webapp will need to send automated emails like password resets and notifications. I recommend Resend of its simple setup and competitive pricing. Other alternatives include Postmark, Amazon SES(really cheap), and Mailgun.\n\n## Marketing Emails\nIf you want to collect emails and send marketing campaigns, you need an email marketing service. If you’re just starting and want something affordable, Mailcoach or EmailOctopus are easy to set up. In particular Mailcoach is really cheap and I recommend it.\n![](https://writings.operational.co/assets/7b2c90a5-8ab7-4412-9b5c-cdafb3cbd2e7)\n\nIf you need a more advanced setup with automation, consider Resend&#39;s marketing email feature, Loops, Encharge, or Userlist. The goal is to make sure you can engage and retain your customers effectively.\n\n## Documentation\nThis is arguably the most important step. You want to keep ALL your information organized somewhere. I recommend Notion for documenting server logins, app credentials, server setups, workflows, etc.\n\nHere&#39;s my Notion for managing Swipekit:\n![](https://writings.operational.co/assets/5770c00e-3420-4579-b62b-8d24c3aeead6)\n\nHaving everything in one place prevents confusion and makes it easy to onboard new team members. If you prefer alternatives, Obsidian (great for offline use), Confluence, or even Google Docs can work just as well. The key is to ensure that your documentation is structured, accessible and available in one place.\n\n## Closing Thoughts\nSet up these foundational elements after conducting market research but before starting development.\nThis ensures less headaches, minimizes technical issues later, and allows you to focus on building your SaaS without distractions.\n\n&quot;],&quot;banner_og&quot;:[0,&quot;abac0bb7-9eae-41b7-acca-eaeea855aedd&quot;],&quot;category&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,22],&quot;status&quot;:[0,&quot;published&quot;],&quot;sort&quot;:[0,13],&quot;date_created&quot;:[0,&quot;2024-07-18T06:16:07.000Z&quot;],&quot;date_updated&quot;:[0,&quot;2025-02-05T00:58:53.000Z&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Understanding and handling operating expenses for your SaaS&quot;],&quot;banner&quot;:[0,&quot;d4777532-f7fb-4f0d-aa21-bf124c8c5618&quot;],&quot;subtitle&quot;:[0,&quot;A Guide for Early-Stage SaaS founders to understand their operating Expenses.&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;saas-operating-expenses&quot;],&quot;content_markdown&quot;:[0,&quot;For bootstrapped SaaS founders, understanding your expenses is critical. Without a clear view of where your money is going, your business can quickly turn into a financial drain.\n\nThis basic guide will help you break down your operating costs, categorize expenses, and figure out how much you should be paying yourself.\n\n## Why Take Note of Your Expenses?\nLet’s say you’ve reached 5K in MRR. That’s a big milestone. At this stage, you might be thinking about quitting your job or even taking on a mortgage. But if you don’t fully understand your expenses, that 5K might not take you as far as you think. \n\nBanks look at your actual profit, not just revenue, when approving loans. If most of your revenue is being eaten up by expenses, you might need to increase your profit before you can qualify. Keeping track of expenses also helps you see whether your business is actually making money or just breaking even.\n\n## Understanding Opex vs. Capex\nEvery expense falls into one of two categories: operating expenses (Opex) or capital expenses (Capex). This is common accounting terminology, but it’s useful for any founder to understand.\n\nOpex covers ongoing, recurring costs like hosting, file storage, databases, email tools, and customer support software. These are the things you need to keep your business running smoothly.\n\nCapex includes one-time costs like business registration, domain purchases, and software licenses. These tend to be bigger expenses, but they don’t happen every month. Some people classify yearly expenses under Capex, but that’s up to you.\n\n## Basics - Revenue vs. Cash Flow vs. MRR\nRevenue is the total amount of money coming into your business. Profit is what’s left after covering all expenses. MRR, or monthly recurring revenue, represents predictable income but can be misleading if you have a mix of annual and monthly plans. Understanding these numbers will help you make better financial decisions as your SaaS grows.\n\n## Basics - Doing an Audit of Your Expenses\nTo get a better handle on your spending, open a spreadsheet and sort your expenses into three groups:\n\n1. Critical Opex. These are the recurring costs that keep your business running, like hosting, customer support tools, and databases.\n2. Personal expenses. These are things you pay for through the business but also use personally, like a phone bill or travel expenses.\n3. One-time expenses. These include business registration, legal fees, or software purchases that don’t come up every month.\n\nOnce you’ve sorted everything, you’ll have a much clearer picture of where your money is going. When I did this early in my SaaS journey, I realized I was spending too much on tools that didn’t provide much value. Cutting those expenses helped me increase my profit instantly.\n\n## How Much Should You Pay Yourself?\nTo figure out your salary, think about how much you need to live comfortably, not just survive.\n\nFor me, that number was 4K per month. That included living expenses, an emergency buffer, business Opex, and taxes.\n\nThat meant my SaaS had to bring in at least 12,100 per month for me to feel financially secure. This covered my personal expenses + business expenses + extra money(for future Capex) in the business bank account. Anything above that was extra profit.\n\n## What I Learned From Categorizing My Expenses\nWhen I went through this process, I discovered a few key things:\n\n1. My operating costs were too high. I switched from an expensive third-party API to a cheaper alternative and moved from a costly email marketing tool to a per-email-send model. That alone saved me $100 per month.\n2. Keeping a $500 buffer was a good idea. Unexpected refunds, chargebacks, or failed payments can happen at any time, and having a cushion helps smooth things out.\n3. I set up a secondary account to hold extra business profits. This became my war chest for future ventures and unexpected costs.\n\n## What About taxes?\nI set aside tax money in my Capex account. There’s no rigid rule here, but it helps avoid surprises when tax season comes around.\n\n## Running a Tight Ship\nAt 5K MRR, you have to be mindful of every dollar you spend. At 10K, you still need to keep an eye on your expenses. The SaaS world is competitive, and spending money on tools or services that don’t provide real value will hurt your bottom line.\n\nBefore committing to a new service, take a look at the competition and see if there’s a better alternative.\n\n## Closing Thoughts\nUse this guide as a starting point, but also talk to an accountant. They might have even better insights on managing your expenses.\n\nIf you’re wondering when to quit your job, there’s no perfect answer. I left mine at 4K MRR, but I also had 10K saved up, which gave me three months of leeway to push my business forward. \n\nAnd if you’re young and living at home with your parents, this might be the best time to go all in.\n\n&quot;],&quot;banner_og&quot;:[0,&quot;990687c5-08f2-47a0-bf22-5ba3d45d9a37&quot;],&quot;category&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,25],&quot;status&quot;:[0,&quot;published&quot;],&quot;sort&quot;:[0,14],&quot;date_created&quot;:[0,&quot;2024-09-23T12:23:46.000Z&quot;],&quot;date_updated&quot;:[0,&quot;2025-02-04T04:15:39.000Z&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Why we reconcile payments?

Here&#39;s how we do it.&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;reconciliation-payments&quot;],&quot;content_markdown&quot;:[0,&quot;If you’re accepting payments online, you’re likely using Stripe, PayPal, or another fintech provider. These platforms maintain a customer record on their end, which means that every user in your system also exists as a customer in theirs.\n\nWhenever you update a user’s details, you should also update their corresponding customer record in Stripe. However, most of these systems rely on webhooks to sync changes, and webhooks are notoriously unreliable. They fail all the time, can be difficult to debug, and often lead to inconsistencies between your database and Stripe’s records.\n\n## Why Reconciliation is Necessary\n\nWithout proper reconciliation, you can run into serious issues like:\n\n- A user who hasn’t paid still having access to your product.\n- A user who has paid is being locked out due to a missing record or a flag.\n- A deleted user still having an active subscription in Stripe.\n\nThese kinds of mismatches can cause frustration for users and lead to lost revenue or disputes. To avoid these problems, we regularly reconcile our payment records.\n\n## How We Reconcile Payments\nThe process is straightforward: we systematically compare all Stripe records with our database records and vice versa.\n\nWe do this with a cronjob. This cronjob runs daily and does the following:\n\n- Goes through all paid users.\n- Checks whether they have a stripe customerId\n- Checks whether their current stripe plan is active(via the customerId)\n\n### Checking Stripe Against Our Database\nFirst, we pull all active subscriptions from Stripe and extract their customer IDs. Then, we check if each of those customers exists in our database with an active status. If there’s a mismatch, we flag it for manual review.\n\n### Checking Our Database Against Stripe\nNext, we take all paying users from our database and ensure that they have a corresponding customer record in Stripe with a valid payment status. If we find a user who should be paying but isn’t reflected correctly in Stripe, we investigate the discrepancy.\n\n## Handling Reconciliation Issues\nWhenever an issue is detected, I receive a notification and manually investigate the problem.\n\nDepending on how payments are processed and how our database is structured, the resolution may vary.\n\nIn some cases, it’s as simple as deactiving a user who&#39;s not paying; in others, it might require contacting Stripe support or updating our internal logic.\n\n## Lessons Learned\nWe first discovered this issue when we noticed that some users had been using our product for months without paying. It wasn’t an obvious bug, just a silent failure where Stripe’s webhooks didn’t sync properly.\n\nSome people might think, \&quot;Maybe the code is broken?\&quot; That’s always a possibility, but in reality, this one process helps me sleep better at night knowing our revenue tracking is accurate and fair.\n\n## Final Thoughts\nIf you’re running a SaaS that relies on recurring payments, take reconciliation seriously. Payment processors aren’t perfect, and errors will happen. By proactively auditing records, you can prevent revenue leakage, reduce disputes, and ensure that users are charged correctly for the services they use.\n\n&quot;],&quot;banner_og&quot;:[0,null],&quot;category&quot;:[0,null]}]]]}" ssr client="load" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Footer&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}" await-children><div
